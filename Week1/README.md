# Week 1

## Q1 Hello World

I ran the program and it printed "Hello World"

## Q2 Creating a new project

I followed the instructions and created a new project and coded my fahrenheit-celcius converter. After I wrote the program, I had a logic error where no matter what I inputted as the fahrenheit temperature, celcius would always appear as 0. I fixed this by changing the integers used in my conversion equations to include a decimal point.
